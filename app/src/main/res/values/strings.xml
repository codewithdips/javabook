        <item>What is Java?
            Java is a programming language and a platform.
            Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and
            secure programming language.
            Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle)
            in the year 1995.
            James Gosling is known as the father of Java. Before Java,
            its name was Oak. Since Oak was already a registered company,
            so James Gosling and his team changed the name from Oak to Java.

            Application

            According to Sun, 3 billion devices run Java. There are many devices where Java is currently used.
            Some of them are as follows:
            Desktop Applications such as acrobat reader, media player, antivirus, etc.
            Web Applications such as irctc.co.in, javatpoint.com, etc.
            Enterprise Applications such as banking applications.
             1) Mobile
             2) Embedded System
             3) Smart Card
             4) Robotics
             5) Games, etc.

        <item> The history of Java is very interesting.
            Java was originally designed for interactive television,
            but it was too advanced technology for the digital
            cable television industry at the time.
            The history of Java starts with the Green Team.
            Java team members (also known as Green Team),
            initiated this project to develop a language for
            digital devices such as set-top boxes,
            televisions, etc. However, it was best suited
            for internet programming. Later,
            Java technology was incorporated by Netscape.
            The principles for creating Java programming were
            "Simple, Robust, Portable, Platform-independent,
            Secured, High Performance,
            Multithreaded, Architecture Neutral,
            Object-Oriented, Interpreted, and Dynamic".
